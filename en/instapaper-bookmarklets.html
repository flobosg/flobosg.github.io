        <h1>Two Instapaper bookmarklets</h1>
            <p>As a child, I read everything I could get my hands on: books, magazines, newspapers, etc. That hasn't changed much, except that now I read mainly articles on the internet. This is where <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> comes into play. It helps me to keep things I can't read right away, and check them later when I have more time. However, I tend to accumulate more than what I can read in my free time. To tackle this problem, I made ​​a couple of bookmarklets that improve my experience with this tool.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<h2>Random article</h2>
<p>Sometimes I don't know which article should I read. In such cases I let the computer decide for me. Looking around I found <a href="https://gist.github.com/sillygwailo/8871248">this bookmarklet</a>, which I modified a bit to suit my needs. Depending on where you are when you click on it, this bookmarklet can do two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're not in Instapaper's first page (<code>http://www.instapaper.com/u</code>), it redirects you there.</li>
<li>But, if you're already there, it chooses an article at random from that page and clicks it.</li>
</ul>
<p>To install the bookmarklet, drag the following link to your bookmarks bar.
<a href="javascript:$('.meta_read_time').each(function(){var e='limegreen',t=parseInt($(this).text().slice(2,5),10);if(t&gt;=20){e='red'}else if(t&gt;=10){e='orange'}$(this).css({'background-color':e,color:'white',border:'2px solid '+e})})">Instapaper: Random</a></p>
<p>You can also check the code in <a href="https://gist.github.com/flobosg/a2276c80483a4aa01740">this Github Gist</a>.</p>
<h2>Highlight reading times</h2>
<p>Unlike their mobile equivalents, the Instapaper web app has no option to filter o sort articles according to their duration. When I have little time to read something, there is no quick way to identify short articles. That's why, according to each article's duration, this bookmarklet colors reading times green (0-9 min), orange (10-19 min) or red (≥ 20 min).<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p><img alt="" src="/media/2014/08/instapaper.png" /></p>
<p>Here is the bookmarklet:
<a href="javascript:$('.meta_read_time').each(function(){var color;var time = $(this).text();time = time[1] === '%C2%B7' ? parseInt(time.slice(2)) : parseInt(time);if (time &gt;= 20){color = 'red';} else if (time &gt;= 10){color = 'orange';} else {color = &quot;limegreen&quot;;} $(this).css({'background-color': color, 'color': 'white', 'border': '2px solid '+color});})">Instapaper: Highlight times</a></p>
<p>Like the other bookmarklet, this one is stored as <a href="https://gist.github.com/flobosg/4cfabe3d0592f65ad908">a Github Gist</a> if you want to check it out.</p>
<p>That's it. If you are Instapaper users, I hope these bookmarklets are as useful to some of you as they are to me. Modify them, share them, tell your friends.</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>And I took the opportunity to remember some Javascript and jQuery.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>This would probably look better as an user script that loads with the page, but I like having the option to activate it only when I need it.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
